## This function should accept no arguments and returns nothing.

def hello():
    print("Hey, What's Up!!")

## A function named pack() that accepts three arguments, and returns a single list with the 
#three arguments inside as list elements



## A function called eat_lunch(). This function should accept a list of any length and print out a series of strongs 
## that say "First I eat__"(1st element of the list)
## and "Next I eat __" (following elements of the list).

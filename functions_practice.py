##remember to call all functions in order for them to run
##remember to INDENT.. (WHITE SPACES MATTER)

## A function named hello() that prints a greeting to the user, 
## This function should accept no arguments and returns nothing.





## A function named pack() that accepts three arguments, and returns a single list with the 
#three arguments inside as list elements



## A function called eat_lunch(). This function should accept a list of any length and print out a series of strongs 
## that say "First I eat__"(1st element of the list)
## and "Next I eat __" (following elements of the list).
## If the list is empty, print "My lunchbox is empty!". Function should not return anything
